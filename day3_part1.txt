Algorithm (Step-by-Step)
	//explanation
    1.	Read the entire input
		Continuously read all lines from stdin into a single buffer so we can scan the whole corrupted text at once.
	2.	Scan for the pattern mul(X,Y)
	    •	Walk through the buffer character by character.
	    •.  Whenever you see the substring "mul(", try to parse:
	    •	First number: 1–3 digits.
	    •	Second number: 1–3 digits.
	    •	A closing parenthesis ).
	    •	If any part fails (too many digits, missing comma/parenthesis), skip it.
	3.	Compute and accumulate
	    •   When a valid pair is found, convert both numbers to integers, multiply them, and add to a running total.
	4.	Output the result
	    •	After scanning the entire buffer, print the total sum.

Compile and run
